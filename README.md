## Pros and cons of TDD
The major advantage of TDD is that it can improve code quality and software reliability. By having test cases before code writing, developers will be able to write clear code and will eliminate all codes that violate the test case. Moreover, this will make debugging easier. When there is a bug in the code, test cases will catch it and report it to developers, reducing the time needed to identify and locate bugs. Lastly, it will also help developers to have a clear understanding of what they are doing, and what functionalities they will implement.

In terms of cons, the major drawback of TDD is that it will take time to design and implement test cases, thus will slow down the design process. Moreover, having the test cases implemented before the actual implementation of the software, developers will be limited by those test cases and omit some important features.
